## Getting started
- If there is historical data, identify a threshold based on existing data
- If no existing data, define SLI metrics and measure over set period to identify SLO target

### Achievable SLO
   These are based on historical data, but there is metric/evidence measure user happiness. Existing data and performance does not necessarily indicate weather your systems are working well and users are happy with its performance or not.

### Aspirational Target

3. Walk through the user journey and look for coverage gaps
4. Set aspirational SLO targets based on business needs
