# Resources

All resources belong to a single project.

- Global    : images, snapshots, network etc
- Regional  : External IP addresses, LB 
- Zonal     : Instance, disk etc

## Quotas
All resources are subject to project quotas and limits

- 15 VPC per project
- 5 Admin actions per sec
- 24 CPU per region


## Labels vs Tags
Labels are way to organize resources in GCP. These are user defined strings and propagated through billing. 
Tags are assigned to Instances only. Primary use is networking (firewall rules), and user-defined settings.
